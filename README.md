# Enhancing Prediction of Sentiment score for Patient Drug Review
This project aims to enhance the prediction of sentiment scores from patient drug reviews using advanced natural language processing techniques. By integrating the Harvard IV-4 Psychosociological Dictionary with machine learning models, we improve sentiment analysis tailored for the pharmaceutical sector.

Key Features:
	•	Utilizes a robust dataset from the UCI Repository featuring over 215,000 reviews.
	•	Employs preprocessing techniques including HTML tag removal, stemming, and handling of non-text elements to clean data.
	•	Integrates dictionary-based sentiment classification with machine learning models to generate a composite sentiment score.
	•	Models tested include N-Gram, LightGBM, and TensorFlow, with LightGBM providing the highest accuracy and efficiency.
	•	Provides a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user engagement and sentiment trends over time.

Impact:
	•	Offers precise sentiment predictions to enhance drug recommendation systems, supporting personalized treatment plans and identifying optimal drug alternatives.
	•	Improves the reliability and accuracy of patient feedback analysis in the pharmaceutical industry.

Technology Stack:
	•	Python, with libraries including NLTK, BeautifulSoup, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and LightGBM.
	•	Uses advanced data visualization tools for analysis results and findings.

Future Work:
	•	Plans to expand the sentiment dictionary and refine model accuracy with additional preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
	•	Aims to incorporate dynamic thresholding and time-weighted normalization to further improve sentiment prediction accuracy.
